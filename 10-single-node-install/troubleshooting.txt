Troubleshooting
=====
** Troubleshooting:
If Cassandra isn't starting up, check the logs  in '/var/log/cassandra'  directory

If there is an error about Java class mismatches or Java 7, please do the following fix.
    $ sudo vi /etc/cassandra/conf/cassandra-env.sh
go to around line number 90, just after the line saying '# determine JVM'
add these two lines
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/latest"
export JAVA="$JAVA_HOME/bin/java"

After that the file should look like this...
    # Determine the sort of JVM we'll be running
    export JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/latest"
    export JAVA="$JAVA_HOME/bin/java"
    java_ver_output=`"${JAVA:-java}" -version 2>&1`
save and exit
then start Cassandra again
